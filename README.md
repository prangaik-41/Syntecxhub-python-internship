Internship tasks and weekly submissions for Python Programming at SYNTECXHUB.
# Week 1 – Task 1:
# Project 1: Python Calculator

A simple and clean Python calculator built as part of my SyntecxHub Internship.  
This program takes two numbers, accepts an operator (+, -, *, /), performs the calculation, and returns the result with basic error handling.

The project focuses on practicing core Python concepts such as user input, functions, conditionals, and clean code structure. It is designed to be beginner-friendly while demonstrating clear logic and proper handling of invalid inputs.

---

## Features

- Supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Uses functions to organize and process calculations  
- Handles invalid operators and incorrect inputs  
- Returns clear, readable output for each operation  
- Simple structure suitable for beginners learning Python fundamentals

---

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user to input two numbers  
2. The user selects an operator: +, -, *, or /  
3. The calculator processes the operation and displays the result  
4. If the user enters an invalid operator or non-numeric input, the program handles the error gracefully

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Functions for modular code
- Conditional statements for operation control
- Input handling for user interaction

## Run the Program

Use the following command to execute the script:

#  Project-2 : Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple yet feature-rich **Python Number Guessing Game** that uses loops, conditionals, and the `random` module. The game challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number with hints, difficulty modes, attempt tracking, and a replay option.

---

##  Features

-  **Random Number Generation** using `random.randint()`
- **Difficulty Levels**
  - Easy (1–20)
  - Medium (1–50)
  - Hard (1–100)
-  **Higher / Lower Hints** after every guess
-  **Replay Support** — play unlimited rounds
- **Best Score Tracking** — records the lowest number of attempts
-  Input validation (avoids crashes)
-  Beginner-friendly logic using **loops and conditionals**

---

##  How It Works

1. The player selects a difficulty level.
2. The program generates a random number within the chosen range.
3. The player keeps guessing until they find the correct number.
4. After every guess, the game gives **Higher/Lower hints**.
5. The game tracks the number of attempts.
6. It compares attempts with the **best score** and updates it.
7. The user can **play again** or exit the game.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- `random` module
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditionals (`if/elif/else`)
- User input handling

##  Run the Program

Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash

python calculator.py
python guess_game.py

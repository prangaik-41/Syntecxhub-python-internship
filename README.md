# Week 1 – Task 1: Python Calculator

A simple and clean Python calculator built as part of my SyntecxHub Internship.  
This program takes two numbers, accepts an operator (+, -, *, /), performs the calculation, and returns the result with basic error handling.  
Designed to practice core Python concepts such as functions, user input, and conditional logic while maintaining readable and beginner-friendly code.
# 🧠 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple yet feature-rich **Python Number Guessing Game** that uses loops, conditionals, and the `random` module. The game challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number with hints, difficulty modes, attempt tracking, and a replay option.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎲 **Random Number Generation** using `random.randint()`
- 🎚 **Difficulty Levels**
  - Easy (1–20)
  - Medium (1–50)
  - Hard (1–100)
- 💡 **Higher / Lower Hints** after every guess
- 🔁 **Replay Support** — play unlimited rounds
- 🏆 **Best Score Tracking** — records the lowest number of attempts
- 🔢 Input validation (avoids crashes)
- ⏱ Beginner-friendly logic using **loops and conditionals**

## 📂 How It Works

1. The player selects a difficulty level.
2. The program generates a random number within the chosen range.
3. The player keeps guessing until they find the correct number.
4. After every guess, the game gives **Higher/Lower hints**.
5. The game tracks the number of attempts.
6. It compares attempts with the **best score** and updates it.
7. The user can **play again** or exit the game.

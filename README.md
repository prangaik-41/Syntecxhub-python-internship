Internship tasks and weekly submissions for Python Programming at SYNTECXHUB.
# Week 1 – Task 1: Python Calculator

A simple and clean Python calculator built as part of my SyntecxHub Internship.  
This program takes two numbers, accepts an operator (+, -, *, /), performs the calculation, and returns the result with basic error handling.  
Designed to practice core Python concepts such as functions, user input, and conditional logic while maintaining readable and beginner-friendly code.
